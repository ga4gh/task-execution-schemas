    ## Executive Summary

    The Task Execution Service (TES) API is an effort to define a standardized
    schema and API for describing batch execution tasks. A task defines a set of
    input files, a set of (Docker) containers and commands to run, a set of
    output files, and some other logging and metadata.

        has been started.

        An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not

        and output files have been successfully uploaded.
         - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
        this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.
         - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
        for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out

        of disk space, etc.

            Volumes are directories which may be used to share data between
            Executors. Volumes are initialized as empty directories by the
            system when the task starts and are mounted at the same path
            in each Executor.

            For example, given a volume defined at "/vol/A",
            executor 1 may write a file to "/vol/A/exec1.out.txt", then
            executor 2 may read from that file.

            (Essentially, this translates to a `docker run -v` flag where
            the container path is the same for each executor).

            System logs are any logs the system decides are relevant,
            which are not tied directly to an Executor process.
            Content is implementation specific: format, size, etc.

            System logs may be collected here to provide convenient access.

            For example, the system may include the name of the host
            where the task is executing, an error message that caused
            a SYSTEM_ERROR state (e.g. disk is full), etc.

            System logs are only included in the FULL task view.

            services with custom APIs not standardized by GA4GH, or
            implementations diverging from official GA4GH specifications, use a
            different namespace (e.g. your organization's reverse domain name).
