TES Governance and Process
==============================

The Task Execution Service (TES) operates under a community-driven development model, where advancements to the specification occur exclusively through community contributions. The governance is steered by a core team of API champions that fosters collaboration and consensus among contributors. This team is tasked with overseeing the design and development processes, setting priorities, managing the release schedule, and making decisions in instances where consensus cannot be reached.

Current API Product leads are:
