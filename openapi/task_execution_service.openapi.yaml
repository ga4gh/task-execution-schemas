    ## Executive Summary

    The Task Execution Service (TES) API is a standardized schema and API for
    describing and executing batch execution tasks. A task defines a set of
    input files, a set of containers and commands to run, a set of
    output files and some other logging and metadata.


    TES servers accept task documents and execute them asynchronously on
    available compute resources. A TES server could be built on top of
    a traditional HPC queuing system,
    such as Grid Engine, Slurm or cloud style compute systems such as AWS Batch
    or Kubernetes.

    ## Introduction

    This document describes the TES API and provides details on the specific
    endpoints, request formats, and responses. It is intended to provide key
    information for developers of TES-compatible services as well as clients
    that will call these TES services. Use cases include:

      - Deploying existing workflow engines on new infrastructure. Workflow engines
      such as CWL-Tes and Cromwell have extentions for using TES. This will allow
      a system engineer to deploy them onto a new infrastructure using a job scheduling
      system not previously supported by the engine.

      - Developing a custom workflow management system. This API provides a common
      interface to asynchronous batch processing capabilities. A developer can write
      new tools against this interface and expect them to work using a variety of
      backend solutions that all support the same specification.


    ## Standards

    The TES API specification is written in OpenAPI and embodies a RESTful service
    philosophy. It uses JSON in requests and responses and standard
    HTTP/HTTPS for information transport. HTTPS should be used rather than plain HTTP
    except for testing or internal-only purposes.

    ### Authentication and Authorization

    Is is envisaged that most TES API instances will require users to authenticate to use the endpoints.
    However, the decision if authentication is required should be taken by TES API implementers.


    If authentication is required, we recommend that TES implementations use an OAuth2  bearer token, although they can choose other mechanisms if appropriate.


    Checking that a user is authorized to submit TES requests is a responsibility of TES implementations.

    ### CORS

    If TES API implementation is to be used by another website or domain it must implement Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
    Please refer to https://w3id.org/ga4gh/product-approval-support/cors for more information about GA4GH’s recommendations and how to implement CORS.

        description: |-
          OPTIONAL. Provide key tag to filter. The field tag_key is an array
          of key values, and will be zipped with an optional tag_value array.
          So the query:
          ```
            ?tag_key=foo1&tag_value=bar1&tag_key=foo2&tag_value=bar2
          ```

            ?tag_key=foo1
          ```
          Should be constructed into the structure {"foo1" : ""}

          If the tag_value is empty, it will be treated as matching any possible value.
          If a tag value is provided, both the tag's key and value must be exact
          matches for a task to be returned.
          Filter                            Tags                          Match?

            could be used in conjunction with the input declaration to process
            a data file using a tool that expects STDIN.

            For example, to get the MD5 sum of a file by reading it into the STDIN

            Default behavior of running an array of executors is that execution
            stops on the first error. If `ignore_error` is `True`, then the
            runner will record error exit codes, but will continue on to the next
            tesExecutor.

            a URL reference only, etc.

            In order to capture the full stdout client should set Executor.stdout

            the local scratch space, may be faster despite the latency and
            overhead. This does not mean that the backend will use a streaming
            interface, as it may not be provided by the vendor, but if the
            capacity is avalible it can be used without degrading the

            URL at which the TES server makes the output accessible after the task is complete.
            When tesOutput.path contains wildcards, it must be a directory; see
            `tesOutput.path_prefix` for details on how output URLs are constructed in this case.
            For Example:
             - `s3://my-object-store/file1`
             - `gs://my-bucket/file2`

            Absolute path of the file inside the container.
            May contain pattern matching wildcards to select multiple outputs at once, but mind
            implications for `tesOutput.url` and `tesOutput.path_prefix`.
            Only wildcards defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (POSIX), 12.3 are supported; see
            https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13

            Prefix to be removed from matching outputs if `tesOutput.path` contains wildcards;
            output URLs are constructed by appending pruned paths to the directory specfied
            in `tesOutput.url`.
            Required if `tesOutput.path` contains wildcards, ignored otherwise.

        Task state as defined by the server.

         - `UNKNOWN`: The state of the task is unknown. The cause for this status
          message may be dependent on the underlying system. The `UNKNOWN` states
          provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing so
          that a missing field does not accidentally imply that
          the state is QUEUED.
         - `QUEUED`: The task is queued and awaiting resources to begin computing.
         - `INITIALIZING`: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run.
        For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.
         - `RUNNING`: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor
        has been started.
         - `PAUSED`: The task is paused. The reasons for this would be tied to
          the specific system running the job. An implementation may have the ability
          to pause a task, but this is not required.
         - `COMPLETE`: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
        and output files have been successfully uploaded.
         - `EXECUTOR_ERROR`: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
        this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.
         - `SYSTEM_ERROR`: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
        for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
        of disk space, etc.
         - `CANCELED`: The task was canceled by the user, and downstream resources have been deleted.
         - `CANCELING`: The task was canceled by the user,
        but the downstream resources are still awaiting deletion.
         - `PREEMPTED`: The task is stopped (preempted) by the system. The reasons for this would be tied to
        the specific system running the job. Generally, this means that the system reclaimed the compute
        capacity for reallocation.

            executor 2 may read from that file.
